With this article I set out to create a full stack javascript enviroment using tools and frameworks that are independant of eachother. My goal is to have a complete
React/React Native frontend, powered by websockets and an interchangable nodejs backend. Sounds fun right!

### frontend:
- React
- Gulp
- Stylus
- bootstrap

### backend:
- redis
- nodejs, express or koa?
- socket.io

With React, especially React Native, we can create full blown database driven IOS apps (and soon android) in Javascript. Thats one of the main goals of this project.
I alos would like to figure out if first using react, how hard it is to make the switch to native use.
