        <title>Welcome</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome! This is my new and improved site. I am slowly but surely getting my portfolio together and writing about things.
I am using jekyll as a base to produce my static website. So far so good. Im currently working on a few side projects so expect them to be here. 
I will also be posting dorky codeing posts and tutorials so that I can hopefully spread some knowledge into the internet!&lt;/p&gt;
