![Me Jumping somewhere in Montana, tour 2011ish.](/images/jumper.jpg)

My name is Chris Wahlfeldt, I'm a tech junkie who loves to meld art and programming. 
I am currently employed as a web developer for Adayana government group and I work specifically with Drupal based web sites. 

I am passionated about creating beautiful, simplistic web architectures, while never loosing sight of what drives those architectures in the first place.
Whether it be a website, application, blog, game, I am there in the trenches with my trusty text editor, learning, developing and creating.

My current favorite web related "things" are:

- Creating apps with [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)
- Making games with [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)
- Learning and working with [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
- Using plain ole HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (I think this will always be my favorite web related thing)
