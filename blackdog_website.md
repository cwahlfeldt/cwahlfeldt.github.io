I Designed and developed a website for Blackdog Smoke and Ale House.
The site is built atop wordpress which allows the client to update
the site with content, a blog, create forms, and most importantly 
have up to date menus and information to help customers get
what they need.

The design achieves simplicity by minimalism and basic color. It is fully responsive. Users can look up the 
menu and address on the go making this the one stop shop for a potential customer on any device. 

The site also features a catering order system. The system has simplified the process
of ordering large catering orders by supplamenting an online form that allows sending and receiveing emails.
Fill out the form and receive an email with a receipt of your order.

This project was a great experience. I had a great time working with Blackdog on the design of the site and it has
allowed for a successfull and lasting relationship.
