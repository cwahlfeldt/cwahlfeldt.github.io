# ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Chris

{{ image(src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4119720", position="left", style="round") }}

Im a dad, husband, musician, wannabe game developer and overall pretty chill dude. Professionally, I have been a software developer for the last 10 years. Ive mostly worked at agencies doing a variety of interesting things ranging from wordpress sites to full fledged inventory management systems and realtime data analysis applications.

I am also available for hire as a consultant or developer. If you would like to chat more about what I can offer, hit me up at [chriswahlfeldt@gmail.com](mailto:chriswahlfelt@gmail.com)
