# ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Chris and I write software.

{{ image(src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4119720", position="left", style="round") }}

I am a software developer with over 10 years experience in the industry. I would consider myself a polyglot when it comes to programming. I love learning new languages, libraries and frameworks.
Im passionate about programming and creating stuff.

I am also available for hire as a consultant or engineer. If you would like to chat more about what I can offer, hit me up at [chriswahlfeldt@gmail.com](mailto:chriswahlfelt@gmail.com)

Outside of my professional life I spend most of my time with my 2 kids and my wife. I also play drums and sing in a metal band called Edna. When I get any time I like to work on games or play them.

I currently have a few open source projects in development:

- [Undergang](https://github.com/cwahlfeldt/Undergang): Tactics roguelike game in C# and Godot
- [llming](https://github.com/cwahlfeldt/llming): Chat gui in Rust using libcomsic
- beatboi: Tiny rhythm game that syncs with any audio file
- make-midi: Small server that converts song files to midi
