I finally got around to writing a plugin for WordPress. It's called Bulk Post Importer and it's a simple plugin that allows you to import posts from a CSV file.

Its essentially a rewrite of a plugin I wrote to help import some json data into a custom post type. I figured it would be usful for other people. Check it out [Bulk Post Importer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bulk-post-importer/).
