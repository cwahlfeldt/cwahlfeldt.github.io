<span style="color: red;">&#9825;</span> Rachel,

You are the light of my life. I love you more than anything in the world.

Today is your birthday and its a special one because a year from now you will be my wife (year-ish?).

This year has been crazy! We bought a house, and are now engaged. We both have new jobs and are "adulting" super hard. Although sometimes I can be a grouch - I love you very much and can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.

Babe - have an amazing day because you deserve it. You are sooo hardworking, intelligent, sexy, beautiful, stunning, funny, amazing, beautiful... did I say that already? I cant wait to celebrate you today babe!

Now for the presents! Check your email for a Lush gift card, the engagment ring is happening soon (I SWEAR!), and you get to pick out one awesome item for the house and I'll buy it - within reason of course! (rug(s), decorations, yard stuff...?)
