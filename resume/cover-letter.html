        <p>Dear Hiring Committee,</p>
        <p>
          With over a decade of experience as a web developer, I've built, optimized, and maintained web applications
          that not only function seamlessly but also look great. I'm excited about the opportunity to bring my skills to
          Engineering IT Shared Services and contribute to the mission of the Grainger College of Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          My strengths lie in full-stack development, including building reliable backends, developing user-friendly
          interfaces, and ensuring applications are optimized for performance and scalability. I'm skilled at
          troubleshooting, problem-solving, and collaborating with teams to deliver solutions that align with both
          technical and user requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
          What draws me to this role is your focus on innovation and fostering a supportive work environment. I'm
          someone who values growth and continuous learning, so the chance to work in a setting that prioritizes both
          technical excellence and employee development is incredibly appealing.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’d love the chance to bring my skills and experience to your team and support the impactful work happening at
          the Grainger College of Engineering. Thank you for considering my application—I look forward to the
          opportunity to discuss how I can contribute.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Best,<br />Chris Wahlfeldt</p>
