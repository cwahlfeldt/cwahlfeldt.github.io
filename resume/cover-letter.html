                    <p>Dear {Hiring Manager Name/Title},</p>
                    <p>
                        I'm writing to express my interest in the {Position
                        Title} position with {Company Name}. With 10 years of
                        experience building web applications and digital
                        solutions, I bring a combination of technical expertise
                        and collaborative problem-solving skills that I believe
                        would be valuable to your team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my career, I've focused on developing
                        scalable solutions while maintaining a high standard of
                        code quality. I have experience leading development
                        teams, implementing best practices, and working directly
                        with stakeholders to understand their needs. My
                        background includes successfully delivering projects
                        ranging from {relevant project type 1} to {relevant
                        project type 2} for various industries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What particularly interests me about {Company Name} is
                        {specific company trait or project that interests you}.
                        I enjoy adapting quickly to new tools and approaches,
                        and I'm particularly skilled at bridging the gap between
                        technical requirements and business needs, ensuring that
                        solutions are both elegant and practical.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I look forward to discussing how my background and
                        collaborative approach could contribute to {Company
                        Name}'s continued success.
                    </p>
                    <p>Best regards,</p>
